== Available states

=== `postgres`

Installs and configures both PostgreSQL server and client with creation
of various DB objects in the cluster. This state applies to both Linux
and MacOS.

=== `postgres.client`

Installs the PostgreSQL client binaries and libraries on Linux.

=== `postgres.manage`

Creates such DB objects as: users, tablespaces, databases, schemas and
extensions. See `pillar.example` file for details.

=== `postgres.python`

Installs the PostgreSQL adapter for Python on Linux.

=== `postgres.server`

Installs the PostgreSQL server package on Linux, prepares the DB cluster
and starts the server using packaged init script, job or unit.

Note

For PostgreSQL server before version 10 to work inside a *FreeBSD Jail*
set `sysvshm=new` and `sysvsem=new`. DO NOT SET `allow.sysvipc=1`. It
defeats the purpose of using Jails.

Further information:
https://blog.tyk.nu/blog/freebsd-jails-and-sysv-ipc/

*Running inside a container* (using Packer, Docker or similar tools),
when OS `init` process is not available to start the service and enable
it on "boot", set pillar value:

[source,yaml]
----
postgres:
  bake_image: True
----

This toggles starting PostgreSQL daemon by issuing raw `pg_ctl` or
`pg_ctlcluster` command.

=== `postgres.upstream`

Configures the PostgreSQL Official (upstream) repository on target
system if applicable.

The state relies on the `postgres:use_upstream_repo` Pillar value which
could be set as following:

* `True` (default): adds the upstream repository to install packages
from
* `False`: makes sure that the repository configuration is absent
* `'postgresapp'` (MacOS) uses upstream PostgresApp package repository.
* `'homebrew'` (MacOS) uses Homebrew postgres

The `postgres:version` Pillar controls which version of the PostgreSQL
packages should be installed from the upstream Linux repository.
Defaults to `9.5`.

== Removal states

=== `postgres.dropped`

Meta state to remove Postgres software. By default the release installed
by formula is targeted only. To target multiple releases, set pillar
`postgres.remove.multiple_releases: True`.

=== `postgres.server.remove`

Remove server, lib, and contrib packages. The `postgres.server.remove`
will retain data by default (no data loss) - set pillar
`postgres.remove.data: True` to remove data and configuration
directories also.

=== `postgres.client.remove`

Remove client package.

=== `postgres.dev.remove`

Remove development and python packages.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== `kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `postgres` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.

== Testing with Vagrant

Windows/FreeBSD/OpenBSD testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Virtualbox
* Vagrant

=== Setup

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install --with=vagrant
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in
`kitchen.vagrant.yml`, e.g. `windows-81-latest-py3`.

=== Note

When testing using Vagrant you must set the environment variable
`KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML` to `kitchen.vagrant.yml`. For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml bin/kitchen test      # Alternatively,
$ export KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.vagrant.yml
$ bin/kitchen test
----

Then run the following commands as needed.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the Vagrant instance and runs the `postgres` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the Vagrant instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you RDP/SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
